```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Leaflet Package loading:

We load the Leaflet package:

```{r LeafletPackage,warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

## Getting spatial data:

I searched the web for a good simple spatial data that can be demonstrated using Leaflet mapping tool, and I found this nice website https://simplemaps.com/.
<br/>
I have chosen Bulgaria and downloaded it's spatial data into a ".csv" which can be easily read into r
<br/>
Then after this has had a little bit cleaning the dataset from records with missing data, and reducing variables only to the ones of interest.

```{r BulgariaSpatialDataDownload}
download.file("https://simplemaps.com/static/data/country-cities/bg/bg.csv","./bg.csv")
BulgariaCities<-read.csv("./bg.csv")
BulgariaCities<-BulgariaCities[complete.cases(BulgariaCities),]
BulgariaCities<-BulgariaCities[,c(1,2,3,7,8)]
print(BulgariaCities)
```

## Preparing Icons and Popups:

Before proceeding to process with Leaflet, lets prepare icons and popups to be used.


```{r IconsAndPopups}
BulgariaIcon <- makeIcon(iconUrl="http://www.freeflagicons.com/download/?series=magnified_flag_with_map&country=bulgaria&size=64",
iconWidth = 64, iconHeight = 48,iconAnchorX = 32, iconAnchorY = 24)
#Icon Image
BulgarianPopup<-rep(NA,nrow(BulgariaCities))
for(i in 1:nrow(BulgariaCities)) {
BulgarianPopup[i]<-paste("CITY","=",BulgariaCities[i,1],"<br/>","POPULATION","=",BulgariaCities[i,5])}
#Preparing multiple popups to show each city name , and its population
```

## Adding Multiple markers with Popups to our created map widget:

We use the piping notation "%>%" to chain the stage output as input to next stage:<br/>

* leaflet() will transform our data frame "BulgariaCities" into leaflet map widget.
* addTiles() will add graphics elements and layers to the map widget.
* addMarkers() will take (lat & lng) values in previous output and add graphics elements layer (Icons + Popups) to map widget according to each spatial coordinates (lat & lng).

```{r CreatingMapWidget}
BulgariaCities %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = BulgariaIcon, popup = BulgarianPopup)
```

## Drawing circles with its radius to ahow city population:

* We continue the chaining by adding circles using "addCircles()" function to indicate the population of each city by "radius =" argument.
* "color=" argument will color Capital city with red and other normal cities with blue.

```{r PopulationCircles}
BulgariaCities %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = BulgariaIcon, popup = BulgarianPopup) %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(BulgariaCities$population)*60,color=ifelse(BulgariaCities$capital=="primary","red","blue"))
```

## Adding Legends:

* Last part is to add legend to show our coloring notation: (Capital->"red" , City->"blue")

```{r Legend}
BulgariaCities %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = BulgariaIcon, popup = BulgarianPopup) %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(BulgariaCities$population)*60,color=ifelse(BulgariaCities$capital=="primary","red","blue")) %>%
  addLegend(labels = c("Capital","City"), colors = c("red","blue"))
```
